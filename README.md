# SNHU-word-Frequency-project-3

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
======================================================
The project gave a request from a pretend supermarket. 
The request was that a file needed to be read and each of the words in the file needed to be counted and graphed.
There were three different options requested. One was a visual graph that listed all words and a * to the right for every time that word was found on file.
A file was needed to be created as an output that recorded all the information as well.
This was to test my reading and writing capabilities with C++.

What did you do particularly well?
==================================
I feel like creating the files was very simple. 
I also never created any memory leaks. 
I always close files I'm not using.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
=================================================================================================================
Personally, I hated the way the graph turned out.
I could have made that look way better but the current is very efficient.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
===============================================================================================================================================================
I had to learn <map>.
It works like a dictionary though so it's not all bad.
I try my best to use as few #include lines as possible.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
=================================================================================================
Experience from ZYBooks where I learned more about memory leaks.
My last collage didn't go over that as well as I would have liked but they did really push closing files you weren't using.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
====================================================================
C++ has a very good format with the way applications are written.

#include at the top.
variables.
Functions with variables if needed.
Main application.

If you add proper spacing, consistency, and good comments, it'll look good and will be very readable.
